#### Little Girl Blue - Nina Simone
Sit there and count your fingers
What can you do?
Old girl you're through
Sit there, count your little fingers
Unhappy little girl blue

Sit there and count the raindrops
Falling on you
It's time you knew
All you can ever count on
Are the raindrops
That fall on little girl blue

Won't you just sit there
Count the little raindrops
Falling on you
'Cause it's time you knew
All you can ever count on
Are the raindrops
That fall on little girl blue

No use old girl
You might as well surrender
'Cause your hopes are getting slender and slender
Why won't somebody send a tender blue boy
To cheer up little girl blue

#### Forbidden Fruit - Nina Simone
Eve and Adam had a garden everything was great
Till one day a boy says pardon Miss my name is snake
See that apple over yonder if you'll take a bite
You and Adam both are bound to have some fun tonight
Go on and eat forbidden fruit
It's mighty sweet forbidden fruit
It's quite a treat forbidden fruit
Go ahead and taste it you don't wanna waste it

The Lord had said in the beginning everything is free
Except that apple that leads to sinning so let that apple be
But Eve got tempted so she tried it and as all chicks do
Teaser her man till he decided he'd just try some too
Go on and eat forbidden fruit
It's mighty sweet forbidden fruit
It's quite a treat forbidden fruit
Go ahead and bite it I bet you'd be delighted
​
I hate to tell you all what followed the Lord was most upset
Saw them making love and hollered what have you to add
And when they made a full confession the Lord said hm I see
I guess I'll have to teach you a lesson about not minding me
Go on and eat forbidden fruit
It's mighty sweet forbidden fruit
It's quite a treat forbidden fruit
You're all indebted now you gonna get it

The Lord made Eve Adam's madam have his kids and all
Placed some labour laws on Adam and he made the snake to fall
Ever since the days of Eden folks been sinful my
Nowadays they're even eating apples in their pie
Go on and eat forbidden fruit
It's mighty sweet forbidden fruit
It's quite a treat forbidden fruit
Go ahead and taste it you don't wanna waste it
Oh go ahead and bite it I bet you'd be delighted
You always did it now you'll gonna get it
Forbidden fruit

#### Broadway-Blues-Ballads - Nina Simone
Mr. Backlash, Mr. Backlash
Just who do think I am
You raise my taxes, freeze my wages
And send my son to Vietnam

You give me second class houses
And second class schools
Do you think that all colored folks
Are just second class fools

Mr. Backlash
I'm gonna leave you with the backlash blues

When I try to find a job
To earn a little cash
All you got to offer
Is your mean old white backlash

But the world is big
Big and bright and round
And it's full of folks like me
Who are black, yellow, beige and brown

Mr. Backlash
I'm gonna leave you with the backlash blues

Mr. Backlash, Mr. Backlash
Just what do you think I got to lose
I'm gonna leave you
With the backlash blues

You're the one will have the blues, not me
Just wait and see

I just can't stand it, the way you always put me down
I put a spell on you because you're mine

I put a spell on you because you're mine
You better stop the things that you do
I ain't lyin', no, I ain't lyin'
I just can't stand it babe
The way you're always runnin' 'round
I just can't stand it, the way you always put me down
I put a spell on you because you're mine
I put a spell on you. I put a spell on you
I put a spell on you. I put a spell on you

#### Pastel Blues - Nina Simone

#### Wild Is the Wind - Nina Simone 
Love me, love me, love me, say you do
Let me fly away with you
For my love is like the wind
And wild is the wind

Give me more than one caress
Satisfy this hungriness
Let the wind blow through your heart
For wild is the wind

You touch me
I hear the sound of mandolins
You kiss me
With your kiss my life begins
You're spring to me
All things to me

Don't you know you're life itself
Like a leaf clings to a tree
Oh my darling, cling to me
For we're creatures of the wind
And wild is the wind
So wild is the wind

You touch me
I hear the sound of mandolins
You kiss me
With your kiss my life begins
Daddy, you're spring to me
All things to me

Don't you know you're life itself
Like a leaf clings to a tree
Oh my darling, cling to me
For we're creatures of the wind
And wild is the wind
So wild is the wind

Wild is the wind
Wild is the wind
Wild is the wind

#### High Priestess of Soul - Nina Simone 
This is the end of the line
I've clearly read ever sign
The way you glance at me
Indifferently
And take your hand from mine

This is the end of the line
How can I ever be fine
How helpless I've become
I feel like some discarded valentine

Remember in the beginning
Your winning ways excited me
And all the while I was certain
That we two found a love that comes just to a few

We've reached the end of the line
I hope your dreams turn out fine
I'm awfully tired
And so I guess I'll go
Although it's only nine

But this is the end of the line
The end of the line
#### Nina Simone Meet In The Dark
Meet in the dark
Meet in the dark

Meet in the dark

Oh you can hide behind
A cloudy night
And you

Oh you can hide behind
Oh you can hide behind
A cloudy night
And you

Oh you can't find me now
Oh you can't find me now

'Cause I am humming so low you can't hear
I am humming so low you can't hear me now
I am humming so low you can't hear

Meet in the dark

And when you want everything to stay the same
Then things change
When you want everything to stay the same
Then things change
​
When you want everything to stay the same
Then things change
When you want everything to stay the same
Then things change

But I'll never get tired of singing these songs
I will never get tired of singing these songs
I will never get tired of singing these songs
I will never get tired of singing these songs

#### To Love Somebody - Nina Simone 
There' a light
A certain kind of light
It's never shown on me
I want my whole life to be
Lived with you
Lived with you

There's a way
Everybody say
Do each and every little thing
What good does it bring
If I ain't got you If I ain't got you
If I ain't got you If I ain't got you

You don't know
What it's like
Baby you don't know
What it's like
To love somebody
To love somebody
The way I love you

In my brain
See your face again
I know my frame of mind
You ain't got to be so blind
And I'm blind so blind

But I'm a woman
Can't you see what I am
I live and breathe for you
What good does it do
If I ain't got you If I ain't got you
If I ain't got you If I ain't got you

Say you don't know
What it's like
Baby you don't know what it's like
To love somebody

The way I love you

What it's like
Baby you don't know
What it's like
To love somebody
To love somebody
The way I love you

#### Baltimore - Nina Simone 

#### A Single Woman - Nina Simone 
I live alone.
That hasn't always been easy to do.
But just a single woman;
Some times as night the walls talk back to me.
They seem to say
Wasn't yesterday, a better day.

Always alone at home or in a crowd;
A single woman out on a private cloud;
Caught in a world few people understand.
I am what I am... only one single woman.

There was a time... I can't remember when.
The house was full of love but then again
It might have been imaginations plan,
Just to help along,
One single Woman.
#### Gifted & Black - Nina Simone 
Young, gifted and black
Oh what a lovely precious dream
To be young, gifted and black
Open your heart to what I mean

In the whole world you know
There's a million boys and girls
Who are young, gifted and black
And that's a fact

You are young, gifted and black
We must begin to tell our young
There's a world waiting for you
Yours is a quest that's just begun

When you're feeling really low
Yeah, there's a great truth that you should know
When you're young, gifted and black
Your soul's intact

How to be young, gifted and black
Oh how I long to know the truth
There are times when I look back
And I am haunted by my youth

Oh but my joy of today
Is that we can all be proud to say
To be young, gifted and black
Is where it's at
Is where it's at
Is where it's at

Dragonfly out in the sun you know what I mean, don't you know
Butterflies all havin' fun, you know what I mean
Sleep in peace when day is done, that's what I mean
And this old world, is a new world
And a bold world for me

Stars when you shine, you know how I feel
Scent of the pine, you know how I feel
Oh freedom is mine
And I know how I feel

It's a new dawn
It's a new day
It's a new life
For me

And I'm feeling good

#### My Baby Just Cares for Me - Nina Simone 

#### No Opportunity Necessary, No Experience Needed - Nina Simone 
Yes
​
Step out in the night when you're lonely
Listening for the sounds that your ears don't hear
I know your cross is heavier with every step, every step
But I know a man and he'd walk miles for you

Stop, you stay where you are
Take a look at yourself
Take a good look at yourself

Can't tell your momma
She'd only tell ya
That she told you so
The life you're leading
She won't believe
The real trick of life we all know

Dawn turns to day and the dawning
Daytime, nighttime, and we still can't see
Why must we wait until the morning light
To wake up and be, wake up and be, wake up and be, wake up and be
Wake up and be

Step out in the night when you're lonely
Listen for the sound that your ears don't hear
I know your cross is heavier with every step, every step
But I know a man who'd walk miles for you

Stop, you stay where you are
Take a look at yourself
Take a good look at yourself
​
Can't tell your momma
She'd only tell ya
That she told you so
The life you're leading
She won't believe
The real trick of life we all know

Can't tell your momma
She'd only tell ya
That she told you so
The life you're leading
She won't believe
The real trick of life we all know
#### Who Knows Where the Time Goes- Nina Simone 

(1966) Sandy Denny

Across the evening sky, all the birds are leaving
But how can they know it's time for them to go?
Before the winter fire, I will still be dreaming
I have no thought of time

For who knows where the time goes?
Who knows where the time goes?

Sad, deserted shore, your fickle friends are leaving
Ah, but then you know it's time for them to go
But I will still be here, I have no thought of leaving
I do not count the time

For who knows where the time goes?
Who knows where the time goes?

And I am not alone while my love is near me
I know it will be so until it's time to go
So come the storms of winter and then the birds in spring again
I have no fear of time

For who knows how my love grows?
And who knows where the time goes?
#### Whatever I Am - Nina Simone 
Lead me on girl if you want
Take my heart and my love
Take of me all that you want

And if there's a thing that you need
I give you the breath that I breathe
And if ever you yearn for the love in me

Whenever, wherever, whatever baby
Whenever, wherever, whatever
Ba, ba, baby

Wish I knew if I could
Be the one that you would
Love forever and a day baby
Oh yeah, and if there's a thing that you need
For you and your blood I will bleed
And if ever you yearn for the love in me

Whenever, wherever, whatever baby
Whenever, wherever, whatever

Ba, ba, baby
Ba, ba, baby
Ba, ba, baby

And if there's a thing that you need
I give you the breath
And if ever you yearn for the love in me

Whenever, wherever, whatever baby
Whenever, wherever, whatever
#### Ain't Got No, I Got Life - Nina Simone

Why am I alive anyway?
Yeah, what about God?
Nobody can take away

Got my hair, I got my head
Got my brains, I got my ears
Got my eyes, I got my nose
Got my mouth,
I got my smile

#### Day and Night - Nina Simone 
When you like a fella
Try to treat him right
Give him your attention day and night

When he starts to smilin'
And he's got you uptight
Shower him with kisses day and night

Tell him how you love him
Tell him he's out of sight
Then he'll know you dig him day and night

If he wants to leave you
And you think he might
Beg him not to leave you day and night

Tell him that you're lonely
Tell him that you're cold
Tell him that you need him here to
(Satisfy your soul)

If he likes to dance, now
Tell you what you do
When you see him comin' down the street
You start to (do the bungaloo)

Oh no, even when he's wrong
Tell him that he's right
You can take the blame both day and night

When you like a fella
Try to treat him right
Give him your attention day and night

When he starts to smilin'
And he's got you uptight
Shower him with kisses day and night
#### Don't You Pay Them No Mind - nina simone 
People laugh each time they see us walking by and their whispering just make
You feel like you wanna cry. Keep on walking by my side don't look behind. You
Know I love you, so don't you pay 'em no mind.

People say our love ain't gonna last too long. And they point at us, just like
We've been only carry on, keep on looking in my eyes and we'll be fine. You see
I love you, so don't you pay 'em no mind.

Stay with me and let 'em see, let 'em know that you love me, that you love me, if
It's true who cares what they do? 'Cause I don't need anyone but you. Just you
And me, we're gonna make it all alone. Let them laugh at us, we're gonna build
A world all our own, Keep on then, keep on holdin' on to me, they'll learn in
Time. I really love you, so don't you pay em' no mind. You know I love you, you
Know I can't be without you

#### I Am Blessed - Nina Simone 
Here in the silence, I say a prayer
Though I've never seen you, somehow I know you're there
You're in the faces of the people that I meet
You're as solid as the earth beneath, my feet

So if I should complain
That all I have is not enough
Forgive me, I've been given so much

And I am blessed
Every time I look into my baby's eyes
I think of all the friends who've touched my life
I realise
In a world where some have more and some have less
I have love, and I am blessed

So many changes this world can put you through
Sometimes it's hard to find a way
A heart can get confused
But then I hold you and it all falls into place
You've given me what time cannot erase

So when I'm feeling down or feeling sorry for myself
I look around and its easy to tell
I realise
In a world where some have more and some have less
I have love, and I am blessed

That I am blessed
Every time I look into my baby's eyes
I think of all the friends who've touched my life
​
And I am blessed
Every time I look into my baby's eyes
I think of all the friends who've touched my life
I realise
You've given me such peace and happiness
In this world where some have more and some have less
I have love

And I am
Blessed
