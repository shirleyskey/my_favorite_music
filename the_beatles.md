## 1. A Day in the Life 
Writers: Lennon-McCartney

Recorded: January 19 and 20, February 3, 10 and 22, 1967

Released: June 2, 1967

***English***
I read the news today, oh, boy

About a lucky man who made the grade

And though the news was rather sad

Well I just had to laugh

I saw the photograph

 
He blew his mind out in a car

He didn't notice that the lights had changed

A crowd of people stood and stared

They'd seen his face before

Nobody was really sure if he was from the House of Lords

 
I saw a film today, oh, boy

The English Army had just won the war

A crowd of people turned away

But I just had to look

Having read the book

I'd love to turn you on

 
Woke up

Got out of bed,

Dragged a comb across my head

Found my way downstairs and drank a cup

And looking up I noticed I was late

 
Found my coat

And grabbed my hat

Made the bus in seconds flat

Found my way upstairs and had a smoke

And somebody spoke

And I went into a dream

 
Laa la la la

La la laa-aah

 
Laa-aah laa

La la laa-aah

 
I read the news today, oh, boy

Four thousand holes in Blackburn, Lancashire

And though the holes were rather small

They had to count them all

Now they know how many holes it takes to fill the Albert Hall.

 
I'd love to turn you on


## 2. I want to hold your hand 
Oh yeah, I'll tell you somethin'

I think you'll understand

When I say that somethin'

I want to hold your hand

I want to hold your hand

I want to hold your hand


Oh please, say to me

You'll let me be your man

And please, say to me

You'll let me hold your hand

Now, let me hold your hand

I want to hold your hand


And when I touch you

I feel happy inside

It's such a feelin' that my love

I can't hide

I can't hide

I can't hide


Yeah, you got that somethin'

I think you'll understand

When I say that somethin'

I want to hold your hand

I want to hold your hand

I want to hold your hand


And when I touch you

I feel happy inside

It's such a feelin' that my love

I can't hide

I can't hide

I can't hide


Yeah, you got that somethin'

I think you'll understand

When I feel that somethin'

I want to hold your hand

I want to hold your hand

I want to hold your hand

I want to hold your hand


## 3. Strawberry Fields Forever
Let me take you down

'Cause I'm going to Strawberry Fields

Nothing is real

And nothing to get hung about

Strawberry Fields forever


Living is easy with eyes closed

Misunderstanding all you see

It's getting hard to be someone

But it all works out

It doesn't matter much to me


Let me take you down

'Cause I'm going to Strawberry Fields

Nothing is real

And nothing to get hung about

Strawberry Fields forever


No one I think is in my tree

I mean, it must be high or low

That is, you can't, you know, tune in

But it's all right

That is, I think it's not too bad


Let me take you down

'Cause I'm going to Strawberry Fields

Nothing is real

And nothing to get hung about

Strawberry Fields forever


Always know, sometimes think it's me

But you know I know when it's a dream

I think a 'no', I mean a 'yes'

But it's all wrong

That is, I think I disagree

​
Let me take you down

'Cause I'm going to Strawberry Fields

Nothing is real

And nothing to get hung about

Strawberry Fields forever

Strawberry Fields forever

Strawberry Fields forever


## 4. Yesterday
Yesterday

All my troubles seemed so far away

Now it looks as though they're here to stay

Oh, I believe in yesterday

 
Suddenly

I'm not half the man I used to be

There's a shadow hanging over me

Oh, yesterday came suddenly

 
Why she

Had to go I don't know, she wouldn't say

I said

Something wrong, now I long for yesterday

 
Yesterday

Love was such an easy game to play

Now I need a place to hide away

Oh, I believe in yesterday

 
Why she

Had to go I don't know, she wouldn't say

I said

Something wrong, now I long for yesterday

 
Yesterday

Love was such an easy game to play

Now I need a place to hide away

Oh, I believe in yesterday


## 5. In My Life
There are places I'll remember

All my life, though some have changed

Some forever, not for better

Some have gone and some remain

All these places had their moments

With lovers and friends, I still can recall

Some are dead and some are living

In my life, I've loved them all

 
But of all these friends and lovers

There is no one compares with you

And these memories lose their meaning

When I think of love as something new

Though I know I'll never lose affection

For people and things that went before

I know I'll often stop and think about them

In my life, I'll love you more

 
Though I know I'll never lose affection

For people and things that went before

I know I'll often stop and think about them

In my life, I'll love you more


## 6. Something
Something in the way she moves

Attracts me like no other lover

Something in the way she woos me

I don't want to leave her now

You know I believe and how

 
Somewhere in her smile she knows

That I don't need no other lover

Something in her style that shows me

Don't want to leave her now

You know I believe and how

 
You're asking me will my love grow

I don't know, I don't know

You stick around now it may show

I don't know, I don't know

 
Something in the way she knows

And all I have to do is think of her

Something in the things she shows me

Don't want to leave her now

You know I believe and how


## 7. Hey Jude
"What's that?

Camel sunshine"


Hey, hey, he-he-he-hey!


Hey Jude, don't make it bad

Take a sad song and make it better

Remember to let her into your heart

Then you can start to make it better


Hey Jude, don't be afraid

You were made to go out and get her

The minute you let her under your skin

Then you begin to make it better


Oh-oh-oh, and anytime you feel the pain

Hey Jude, refrain

Don't carry the world upon your shoulders

For well you know that it's a fool

Who plays it cool

By making his world a little colder

She has found you, now go and get her

Remember to let her into your heart

Then you can start to make it better

Better, better, better


So let it out and let it in

## 12. Tomorrow Never Knows
We were talking about the space between us all

And the people who hide themselves behind a wall of illusion

Never glimpse the truth then it's far too late

When they pass away We were talking about the love

We all could share when we find it

To try our best to hold it there with our love

With our love we could save the world if they

Only knew Try to realize it's all within yourself

No one else can make you change

And to see you're really only very small

And life flows within you and

Without you We were talking about the love

That's gone so cold and the people

Who gain the world and lose their soul

They don't know they can't see,

Are you one of them? When you've seen beyond yourself

Then you may find, peace of mind is waiting there

And the time will come when you see

We're all one and life flows on within you and without you

## 14. The Ballad Of John And Yoko
Standing in the dock at Southampton

Trying to get to Holland or France

The man in the mac said

"You've got to go back."

You know, they didn't even give us a chance


Christ, you know it ain't easy

You know how hard it can be

The way things are going

They're going to crucify me


Finally made the plane into Paris

Honeymooning down by the Seine

Peter Brown called to say

You can make it okay

You can get married in Gibraltar near Spain


Christ, you know it ain't easy

You know how hard it can be

The way things are going

They're going to crucify me


Drove from Paris to the Amsterdam Hilton

Talking in our beds for a week

The news people said

"Say, what you doing in bed?"

I said, "We're only trying to get us some peace"


Christ, you know it ain't easy

You know how hard it can be

The way things are going

They're going to crucify me


Saving up your money for a rainy day

Giving all your clothes to charity

Last night the wife said

"Oh boy, when you're dead

You don't take nothing with you but your soul

Think!"

​
Made a lightning trip to Vienna

Eating chocolate cake in a bag

Newspapers said

"She's gone to his head.

They look just like two gurus in drag."


Christ, you know it ain't easy

You know how hard it can be

The way things are going

They're going to crucify me


Caught the early plane back to London

Fifty acorns tied in a sack

The men from the press

Said, "We wish you success.

It's good to have the both of you back."


Christ, you know it ain't easy

You know how hard it can be

The way things are going

They're going to crucify me

The way things are going

They're going to crucify me

## 15. The Night Before
We said our goodbyes

On the night before

Love was in your eyes

On the night before

Now today I find

You have changed your mind

Treat me like you did the night before

 
Were you telling lies

On the night before?

Was I so unwise

On the night before?

When I held you near

You were so sincere

Treat me like you did the night before

 
Last night is a night I will remember you by

When I think of things we did

It makes me wanna cry

 
We said our goodbye

On the night before

Love was in your eyes

On the night before

Now today I find

You have changed your mind

Treat me like you did the night before

 
When I held you near

You were so sincere

Treat me like you did the night before

 
Last night is a night I will remember you by

When I think of things we did

It makes me wanna cry

 
Were you telling lies

On the night before?

Was I so unwise

On the night before?

 
When I held you near

You were so sincere

Treat me like you did the night before

## 16. Got to Get You Into My Life
I was alone, I took a ride

I didn't know what I would find there

Another road where maybe I could see another kind of mind there

 
Ooh, then I suddenly see you

Ooh, did I tell you I need you

Every single day of my life

 
You didn't run, you didn't lie

You knew I wanted just to hold you

And had you gone you knew in time we'd meet again

For I had told you

 
Ooh, you were meant to be near me

Ooh, and I want you hear me

Say we'll be together every day

 
Got to get you into my life

 
What can I do, what can I be

When I'm with you I want to stay there

If I'm true I'll never leave

And if I do I know the way there

 
Ooh, then I suddenly see you

Ooh, did I tell you I need you

Every single day of my life

 
Got to get you into my life

Got to get you into my life

 
I was alone, I took a ride

I didn't know what I would find there

Another road where maybe I could see another kind of mind there

 
Then suddenly I see you

Did I tell you I need you

Every single day?
