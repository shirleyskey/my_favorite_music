Writers: Lennon-McCartney

Recorded: January 19 and 20, February 3, 10 and 22, 1967

Released: June 2, 1967

***English***
I read the news today, oh, boy

About a lucky man who made the grade

And though the news was rather sad

Well I just had to laugh

I saw the photograph

 
He blew his mind out in a car

He didn't notice that the lights had changed

A crowd of people stood and stared

They'd seen his face before

Nobody was really sure if he was from the House of Lords

 
I saw a film today, oh, boy

The English Army had just won the war

A crowd of people turned away

But I just had to look

Having read the book

I'd love to turn you on

 
Woke up

Got out of bed,

Dragged a comb across my head

Found my way downstairs and drank a cup

And looking up I noticed I was late

 
Found my coat

And grabbed my hat

Made the bus in seconds flat

Found my way upstairs and had a smoke

And somebody spoke

And I went into a dream

 
Laa la la la

La la laa-aah

 
Laa-aah laa

La la laa-aah

 
I read the news today, oh, boy

Four thousand holes in Blackburn, Lancashire

And though the holes were rather small

They had to count them all

Now they know how many holes it takes to fill the Albert Hall.

 
I'd love to turn you on


## 2. I want to hold your hand 
Oh yeah, I'll tell you somethin'

I think you'll understand

When I say that somethin'

I want to hold your hand

I want to hold your hand

I want to hold your hand


Oh please, say to me

You'll let me be your man

And please, say to me

You'll let me hold your hand

Now, let me hold your hand

I want to hold your hand


And when I touch you

I feel happy inside

It's such a feelin' that my love

I can't hide

I can't hide

I can't hide


Yeah, you got that somethin'

I think you'll understand

When I say that somethin'

I want to hold your hand

I want to hold your hand

I want to hold your hand


And when I touch you

I feel happy inside

It's such a feelin' that my love

I can't hide

I can't hide

I can't hide


Yeah, you got that somethin'

I think you'll understand

When I feel that somethin'

I want to hold your hand

I want to hold your hand

I want to hold your hand

I want to hold your hand


## 3. Strawberry Fields Forever
Let me take you down

'Cause I'm going to Strawberry Fields

Nothing is real

And nothing to get hung about

Strawberry Fields forever


Living is easy with eyes closed

Misunderstanding all you see

It's getting hard to be someone

But it all works out

It doesn't matter much to me


Let me take you down

'Cause I'm going to Strawberry Fields

Nothing is real

And nothing to get hung about

Strawberry Fields forever


No one I think is in my tree

I mean, it must be high or low

That is, you can't, you know, tune in

But it's all right

That is, I think it's not too bad


Let me take you down

'Cause I'm going to Strawberry Fields

Nothing is real

And nothing to get hung about

Strawberry Fields forever


Always know, sometimes think it's me

But you know I know when it's a dream

I think a 'no', I mean a 'yes'

But it's all wrong

That is, I think I disagree

​
Let me take you down

'Cause I'm going to Strawberry Fields

Nothing is real

And nothing to get hung about

Strawberry Fields forever

Strawberry Fields forever

Strawberry Fields forever


## 4. Yesterday
Yesterday

All my troubles seemed so far away

Now it looks as though they're here to stay

Oh, I believe in yesterday

 
Suddenly

I'm not half the man I used to be

There's a shadow hanging over me

Oh, yesterday came suddenly

 
Why she

Had to go I don't know, she wouldn't say

I said

Something wrong, now I long for yesterday

 
Yesterday

Love was such an easy game to play

Now I need a place to hide away

Oh, I believe in yesterday

 
Why she

Had to go I don't know, she wouldn't say

I said

Something wrong, now I long for yesterday

 
Yesterday

Love was such an easy game to play

Now I need a place to hide away

Oh, I believe in yesterday


## 5. In My Life
There are places I'll remember

All my life, though some have changed

Some forever, not for better

Some have gone and some remain

All these places had their moments

With lovers and friends, I still can recall

Some are dead and some are living

In my life, I've loved them all

 
But of all these friends and lovers

There is no one compares with you

And these memories lose their meaning

When I think of love as something new

Though I know I'll never lose affection

For people and things that went before

I know I'll often stop and think about them

In my life, I'll love you more

 
Though I know I'll never lose affection

For people and things that went before

I know I'll often stop and think about them

In my life, I'll love you more


## 6. Something
Something in the way she moves

Attracts me like no other lover

Something in the way she woos me

I don't want to leave her now

You know I believe and how

 
Somewhere in her smile she knows

That I don't need no other lover

Something in her style that shows me

Don't want to leave her now

You know I believe and how

 
You're asking me will my love grow

I don't know, I don't know

You stick around now it may show

I don't know, I don't know

 
Something in the way she knows

And all I have to do is think of her

Something in the things she shows me

Don't want to leave her now

You know I believe and how


## 7. Hey Jude
"What's that?

Camel sunshine"


Hey, hey, he-he-he-hey!


Hey Jude, don't make it bad

Take a sad song and make it better

Remember to let her into your heart

Then you can start to make it better


Hey Jude, don't be afraid

You were made to go out and get her

The minute you let her under your skin

Then you begin to make it better


Oh-oh-oh, and anytime you feel the pain

Hey Jude, refrain

Don't carry the world upon your shoulders

For well you know that it's a fool

Who plays it cool

By making his world a little colder


Na


Hey Jude, don't let me down

She has found you, now go and get her

Remember to let her into your heart

Then you can start to make it better

Better, better, better


So let it out and let it in

Hey Jude, begin

You're waiting for someone to perform with

And don't you know that it's just you

Hey Jude, you'll do

The movement you need is on your shoulder

La, la, la, la, la

La, la, la, la, mm

​
Hey Jude, don't make it bad

Take a sad song and make it better

The minute you let her into your heart

Then you can start to make it better

## 8. Let It Be 
When I find myself in times of trouble

Mother Mary comes to me

Speaking words of wisdom

Let it be

 
And in my hour of darkness

She is standing right in front of me

Living in the world agree

There will be an answer

There is still a chance that they will see

There will be answer

## 12. Tomorrow Never Knows
We were talking about the space between us all

And the people who hide themselves behind a wall of illusion

Never glimpse the truth then it's far too late

When they pass away We were talking about the love

We all could share when we find it

To try our best to hold it there with our love

With our love we could save the world if they

Only knew Try to realize it's all within yourself

No one else can make you change

And to see you're really only very small

And life flows within you and

Without you We were talking about the love

That's gone so cold and the people

Who gain the world and lose their soul

They don't know they can't see,

Are you one of them? When you've seen beyond yourself

Then you may find, peace of mind is waiting there

And the time will come when you see

We're all one and life flows on within you and without you
