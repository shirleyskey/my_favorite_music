#### 1. Moon River - Audrey Hepburn 
Moon river, wider than a mile

I'm crossing you in style some day
Oh, dream maker, you heart breaker
Wherever you're goin', I'm goin' your way

Two drifters, off to see the world
There's such a lot of world to see
We're after the same rainbow's end, waitin' 'round the bend
My huckleberry friend, moon river, and me

#### 2. Somewhere Over The Rainbow
Hoo, hoo
Hoo, hoo, hoohoohoo
Hoo, hoo, hoo
Hoo, hoo
Hoo, hoo, hoo
Hoo, hoo, hoo
Ho, ho, ho

Somewhere over the rainbow
Way up high
And the dreams that you dreamed of
Once in a lullaby

Oh, somewhere over the rainbow
Blue birds fly
And the dreams that you dreamed of
Dreams really do come true

Someday I'll wish upon a star
Wake up where the clouds are far behind me
Where trouble melts like lemon drops
High above the chimney top, that's where you'll find me

Oh, somewhere over the rainbow
Blue birds fly
And the dream that you dare to
Oh why, oh why can't I?

Well, I see trees of green and red roses too
I'll watch them bloom for me and you
And I think to myself
What a wonderful world

Well, I see skies of blue, and I see clouds of white
And the brightness of day, I like the dark
And I think to myself
What a wonderful world

The colors of the rainbow so pretty in the sky
Are also on the faces of people passing by
I see friends shaking hands
Saying "How do you do?"
They're really saying "I, I love you"
â€‹
I hear babies cry, and I watch them grow
They'll learn much more than we'll know
And I think to myself
What a wonderful world, world

Someday I'll wish upon a star
Wake up where the clouds are far behind me
Where trouble melts like lemon drops
High above the chimney top, that's where you'll find me

Oh, somewhere over the rainbow
Way up high
And the dream that you dare to
Why, oh why can't I?

Hoo, hoo
Hoo, hoo, hoohoohoo
Hoo, hoo
Hoo, hoo
Hoo, hoo, hoohoo
Hoo, ha, ha, hi, ha
Hanhanhanhanhan, han, han, han

#### 3. Rain & Tears 
Rain and tears, are the same
But in the sun
You've got to play the game
When you cry
In winter time
You can pretend
It's nothing but the rain
How many times I've seen
Tears coming from your blue eyes
Rain and tears, are the same
But in the sun
You've got to play the game
Give me an answer of love
(O----ooohhh)
I need an answer of love
(O----ooohhh)
Rain and tears in the sun
But in your heart
You feel the rainbow waves
Rain and tears
Both I shun
For in my heart there 'll never be a sun
Rain and tears, are the same
But in the sun
You've got to play the game
Game...
